\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the transformation of emulation-style LLVM IR
(EIR) into high-level LLVM IR (HIR) to combine the functional correctness of
EIR with the analysis suitability of HIR. Our study focused on eliminating the
virtual stack in BinRec-generated EIR while preserving the original program
semantics. To achieve this, we proposed two approaches: (1) variable recovery
using symbolic execution, and (2) type recovery using points-to graph analysis.
In future work, we plan to extend our framework to recover array types,
function structures, and other high-level constructs, thereby enabling complete
removal of the virtual stack. The ultimate goal is to achieve analysis
suitability comparable to that of high-level style IR, without sacrificing
functional correctness.
